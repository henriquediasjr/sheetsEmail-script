Subject: Application for Full-Stack Developer Opportunity

Dear {companyName} Team,

My name is Henrique Dias, and I am a 19-year-old software engineering student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at PUC-PR, Brazil. With over four years of experience in web development, I specialize in Laravel, Vue.js, ReactJS, and Symfony, and I have worked on projects like migrating the Millarch.org website to Drupal 10 and building efficient CRUD systems.

As a proactive self-learner, I continuously expand my technical expertise through certifications in advanced Laravel and JavaScript, staying updated with the latest technology trends. I am eager to bring my skills and dedication to your team and contribute to impactful projects.

I have attached my resume for your review and would be thrilled to discuss how I can add value to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,  
Henrique Dias
